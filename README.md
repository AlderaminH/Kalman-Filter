Park Seong-soo(pasus) is one of the authority figures in the field of Kalman Filter
 and he is the author of the book 'Kalman Filter Algorithm Solving with Mathematical'.

This repository is an implementation of examples from his book.
 I followed his code as it is, but modified it a little to fit my coding style.
 Finally, an attempt was made to functionalize the code for reuse or reprogramming.
